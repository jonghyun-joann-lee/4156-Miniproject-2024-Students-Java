1. UnusedPrivateField
    - Location: Department.java, line 117
    - Avoid unused private fields such as 'departmentChair'.
    - Fixing the getDepartmentChair() method to return the correct value (this.departmentChair) resolved this issue.

2. ConstructorCallsOverridableMethod
    - Location: MyFileDatabase.java, line 26
    - Overridable method called during object construction: MyFileDatabase.deSerializeObjectFromFile()
    - Changed the deSerializeObjectFromFile() method from public to private to make it not overridable.

3. ReturnEmptyCollectionRatherThanNull
    - Location: MyFileDatabase.java, line 54
    - Return an empty collection rather than null.
    - Fixed the line to return an empty map to avoid potentially having NullPointerException later
