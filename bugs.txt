<Bugs found by PMD and fixed>

1. UnusedPrivateField
    - Location: Department.java, line 117
    - Avoid unused private fields such as 'departmentChair'.
    - Fixing the getDepartmentChair() method to return the correct value (this.departmentChair) resolved this issue.

2. ConstructorCallsOverridableMethod
    - Location: MyFileDatabase.java, line 26
    - Overridable method called during object construction: MyFileDatabase.deSerializeObjectFromFile()
    - Changed the deSerializeObjectFromFile() method from public to private to make it not overridable.

3. ReturnEmptyCollectionRatherThanNull
    - Location: MyFileDatabase.java, line 54
    - Return an empty collection rather than null.
    - Fixed the line to return an empty map to avoid potentially having NullPointerException later

4. AvoidDuplicateLiterals
    - Location: RouteController.java, line 40 (line number is based on before modifying the file)
    - The String literal "deptCode" appears 15 times in this file; the first occurrence is on line 40
    - Defined a constant instead of using the same string literals repeatedly

5. UseLocaleWithCaseConversions
    - Location: RouteController.java, line 54
    - When doing a String.toLowerCase()/toUpperCase() call, use a Locale
    - Used Locale.ROOT to ensure that results are consistent regardless of the environment

6. AvoidDuplicateLiterals
    - Location: RouteController.java, line 46 (line number is based on before modifying the file)
    - The String literal "Department Not Found" appears 6 times in this file; the first occurrence is on line 46
    - Defined a constant instead of using the same string literals repeatedly

7. UseLocaleWithCaseConversions
    - Location: RouteController.java, line 57
    - When doing a String.toLowerCase()/toUpperCase() call, use a Locale
    - Used Locale.ROOT to ensure that results are consistent regardless of the environment

8. AvoidDuplicateLiterals
    - Location: RouteController.java, line 74 (line number is based on before modifying the file)
    - The String literal "courseCode" appears 10 times in this file; the first occurrence is on line 74
    - Defined a constant instead of using the same string literals repeatedly

9. AvoidDuplicateLiterals
    - Location: RouteController.java, line 84 (line number is based on before modifying the file)
    - The String literal "Course Not Found" appears 10 times in this file; the first occurrence is on line 84
    - Defined a constant instead of using the same string literals repeatedly

10. UnusedLocalVariable
    - Location: RouteController.java, 301
    - Avoid unused local variables such as 'requestedCourse'.
    - Fixing the findCourseTime() method to return the correct value of the course timeslot using the variable requestedCourse resolved this issue.

11. AvoidDuplicateLiterals
    - Location: RouteController.java, line 428 (line number is based on before modifying the file)
    - The String literal "Attributed was updated successfully." appears 4 times in this file; the first occurrence is on line 428
    - Defined a constant instead of using the same string literals repeatedly


<Other bugs found and fixed>

In Department.java:

1. Line 37, getNumberOfMajors() returning a negated value of this.numberOfMajors
2. Line 46, getDepartmentChair() not returning the actual value of departmentChair but returning a string literal "this.departmentChair"
3. Line 68, dropPersonFromMajor() always decreasing numberOfMajors by one and not checking if it's greater than zero
4. Line 109, toString() not returning the actual value of the string representation but returning a string literal "result.toString()"

In Course.java:

1. Line 26, the constructor initializing enrolledStudentCount to 500 whereas the javadoc comment says the count should start at zero
2. enrollStudent() always increasing enrolledStudentCount and returning false while it should check if there is space available and return true if student is successfully enrolled and false otherwise
3. dropStudent() always decreasing enrolledStudentCount and returning false while it should check if a student is enrolled in the course and return true if student is successfully dropped and false otherwise
4. Line 57, getCourseLocation() returning instructorName instead of courseLocation
5. Line 62, getInstructorName() returning courseLocation instead of instructorName
6. Line 104, isCourseFull() having a logic error of incorrectly returning true when the course is not full (enrollmentCapacity > enrolledStudentCount)

In MyFileDatabase.java:
1. Line 99, the variable filePath can be set as final because the value should not really change after initialization

In RouteController.java:

1. retrieveDepartment() returning the wrong HttpStatus for the if-else cases (was returning OK when department was not found and NOT_FOUND when department was found)
2. retrieveCourse() returning HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN when the course is found while it should return OK
3. getMajorCtFromDept() returning a negated value of the number of majors for the requested department and returning HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN when the department is not found (I think it should be NOT_FOUND)
4. findCourseTime() returning the string literal "some time " instead of the actual timeslot of the course
5. handleException() returning HttpStatus.OK when an error has occurred could be misleading; I think it would be better to return HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR
